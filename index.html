            <p>
                I'm not a professional and I don't take any commissions.<br>
                I only work for myself, these works are the result of my <strike>wasted</strike> free time. :)

                This is the "first" serious web page I've done.<br>
                I made it around the start of 2021.<br>
                It shows different features of the Application.

            <p>
                A website maintained by me and a friend.<br>
                It's where we host most of our projects, like (very) experimental apps and software, or servers.<br>
                I'm the designer, I make most of the frontend, icons, etc.<br>
                I also made the mascot! He's called 1010 (TenTen)!

            <p>
                Except the font (called Libre Caslon), the layout, the animations, the style, the icons, basically everything here, was made by me.<br>
                I tried to keep it simple while it looks good, and I think I did a great job.<br>
                I hope you like it!!

            <h1>About me...</h1>
            <p>
                I'm 16 but I'm still an idiot...<br>
                I don't really drink coffee... (sorry)<br>
                I like cats... Like I'm obsessed with cats, but also with cookies, <i>Frangipane</i> and <i>Galette des rois</i> somehow...<br>
                My favorite video game right now is <a href="https://ddnet.tw">DDRaceNetwork</a>...<br>
                I own 3 computers, 2 of them are laptops, and one of the laptops is used as a server...<br>
                I also own a PS Vita, a Wii U and a Wii (old times!!)...<br>
                <br>
                And... I don't really have much more to say about me...<br>
                Oh wait! I forgot to write "I use arch btw"...
