            </h1>
            <p>
                My username is Tarocafé, I'm 16 years old and I live in region Île-de-France.<br>
                The username "Tarocafé" doesn't really have a meaning, and honestly I don't even drink coffee.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                My passion for computers started when I was 8 years old, and started to do web development around december 2017. I never stopped since then.<br>
                I'm currently planning to use the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust language</a> for my next programming projects.<br>
                I stopped using Windows as my main operating system in 2020, and now I mainly use Linux distributions on my computers.

                I'm not a professional and I don't take any commissions.<br>
                I only work for myself, these works are the result of my <strike>wasted</strike> free time.

                A website maintained by me and a friend.<br>
                It's where we host most of our projects, like (very) experimental apps and software, or servers.<br>
                I'm mostly the designer, I make most of the frontend, icons, etc.<br>
                I also made the mascot! He's called 1010 (TenTen)!

                This is the "first" serious web page I've done.<br>
                I made it around the start of 2021.<br>
                It shows different features of the Application.

                The layout, the animations, the style, the icons, basically everything here (except the fonts), has been made by me.<br>
                I tried to keep it simple while making it looking good, and I think I did a great job.<br>
